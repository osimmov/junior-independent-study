  abstract  = {An increasing number of tools now integrate AI support, extending the ability of users—especially novices—to produce creative work. While AI could play various roles within such tools, less is known about how the positioning of AI affects an individual’s cognitive processes and sense of agency. To examine this relationship, we built a collaborative whiteboard plugin that integrates an LLM into design templates to facilitate reflective brainstorming activities. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with N=47 participants assigned to one of three versions of AI-support—No-AI, AI input provided incrementally (Co-led) and AI provided all at once (AI-led)—to compare the allocation of cognitive resources. Results show that the positioning of AI scaffolds shifts the underlying cognition: AI-led participants devoted more time to comprehension and synthesis, which yielded more topically diverse problems and solutions. No-AI and Co-led participants spent more time revising content and reported higher confidence in their process.},

  annote    = {This paper discusses integrating AI into workflows to improve productivity and provides guidance on how much AI usage is optimal to gain benefits. It is well cited. The authors conducted an experiment with 47 participants, dividing them into three groups and assigning them creative problem-solving tasks. One group used no AI, another worked in a co-led setting with AI, and the third relied primarily on AI. The results showed that participants who used AI generated more ideas and demonstrated higher levels of creativity when solving the problems. They also spent more time reading and synthesizing information.
               
               In this study, the authors aim to understand how different approaches to integrating AI into a creative workflow affect an individual’s ability to reflect and iterate. Their central research question is how the positioning of AI within a creative workflow influences creative outcomes.
               
               Overall, the paper demonstrates that the use of AI can enhance creativity during problem solving. It is directly relevant to my project idea: a productivity-focused platform where users write reflections and receive AI-generated suggestions to improve productivity and efficiency.

  abstract  = {Mental health concerns are prevalent among college students, highlighting the need for effective interventions that promote self-awareness and holistic well-being. MindScape explores a novel approach to AI-powered journaling by integrating passively collected behavioral patterns such as conversational engagement, sleep, and location with Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration creates a highly personalized and context-aware journaling experience, enhancing self-awareness and well-being by embedding behavioral intelligence into AI. We present an 8-week exploratory study with 20 college students, demonstrating the MindScape app’s efficacy in enhancing positive affect (7%), reducing negative affect (11%), loneliness (6%), and anxiety and depression, with a significant week-over-week decrease in PHQ-4 scores (−0.25 coefficient). The study highlights the advantages of contextual AI journaling, with participants particularly appreciating the tailored prompts and insights provided by the MindScape app. Our analysis also includes a comparison of responses to AI-driven contextual versus generic prompts, participant feedback insights, and proposed strategies for leveraging contextual AI journaling to improve well-being on college campuses. By showcasing the potential of contextual AI journaling to support mental health, we provide a foundation for further investigation into the effects of contextual AI journaling on mental health and well-being.},
